# 7. About This Project

This dashboard was built as part of a data challenge by Hey Holy, a brand in the pet wellness space. The task was simple: take a raw e-commerce dataset and bring it to life with real, actionable insights.

I focused on things that truly matter to a growing brand — customer retention, product trends, revenue patterns, and the impact of discounts. The result is a clean, interactive dashboard where anyone (not just data folks) can explore what’s really driving the business.
